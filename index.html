			<h2>A simple library for creating complex neural networks</h2>
		</header>
		<p>
			<strong>DeepLearning.scala</strong> is a deep learning toolkit for Scala,<br/>
			combining object-oriented and functional programming constructs,<br/>
			aims to create statically typed dynamic neural networks<br/>
			from <code>map</code>/<code>reduce</code> and other higher order functions.

				<p style="text-align: justify">
					Neural networks are Monads, which can be created by composing higher order functions.
					Along with the Monad, we also provide an Applicative type class, to perform multiple calculations in parallel.

				<h3 style="white-space: nowrap">Dynamic Neural Networks</h3>
				<p style="text-align: justify">
				Neural networks are programs, too.
				All Scala features, including functions, expressions and control flows, are available in neural networks,
				which can be even evaluated step by step in a Jupyter Notebook.

				<p style="text-align: justify">
					DeepLearning.scala supports plugins. There are <a href="/plugins">various plugins</a> providing algorithms, models, hyperparameters or other features.
					You can <a href="/get-involved">share your own plugins</a> as simple as creating a Github Gist.
