    "Before passing data to the softmax classifier, we first process label data with ([one hot encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-hot)): transform INDArray of `NumberOfPixels × 1` into INDArray of `NumberOfPixels × NumberOfClasses`. The value of correct classification corresponding to each line is 1, and the values of other columns are 0. The reason for differentiating the training set and test set is to make it clear that whether the network is over trained which leads to [overfitting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overfitting). While processing label data, we used [Utils](https://github.com/ThoughtWorksInc/DeepLearning.scala-website/blob/master/ipynbs/Utils.sc), which is also provided in this course."
